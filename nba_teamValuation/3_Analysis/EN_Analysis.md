# Do Star Players Move the “Stock Price” of NBA Teams? ~iD and Event Study: (3/3) The Analysis~

## 1. Introduction: Was It a Coincidence, or Something Real?

In this series, we've been tracking the relationship between star players and a team's enterprise value (Valuation).

In [(1/3) The Big Picture](https://shokubohcm.medium.com/do-star-players-move-the-stock-price-of-nba-teams-13166b3da4e7), we saw a league-wide trend where a star player's transfer coincided with a rise in team value.

In [(2/3) The Case Studies](https://shokubohcm.medium.com/do-star-players-move-the-stock-price-of-nba-teams-163c46237a49), we looked back at the stories behind specific moves, like those of LeBron and KD, along with the data.

Throughout this analysis, we repeatedly saw the phenomenon of a "star player's arrival boosting team value." But a question remained for me: "Can we really trust this 'star effect'?"

When we strip away other factors like the tailwind of the league's overall growth or a team's pre-existing popularity, what is the "net contribution" of a star player?

In this final installment, "The Analysis," I'll try to tackle this question with a statistical approach. Personally, I'm still learning about causal inference, but I wanted to try and get closer to the "net impact" of a star player's arrival on team value in my own way, using methods called "Difference-in-Differences (DiD)" and "Event Study."
